# Creating A Statehouse News Service in 2015

## Intro

## Can I add to this?  

Yes, absolutely.  Here are some instructions on how to add to this repository: [Here's a beginner's guide](https://nerds.inn.org/2015/03/17/contributing-to-the-inn-nerds-docs-repo-using-github-com/). Just substitute this repository for the one used as an example in the tutorial.  

If that feels like too much, you can just click [Issues](https://github.com/lisawilliams/community/issues/new) and let me know what's on your mind.  You'll need a (free) Github account to do so.  

If that still feels like too much, summon me on the Twitter, where I am [@lisawilliams](http://twitter.com/lisawilliams).
