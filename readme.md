# A Job Description for Statehouse News in 2015

## Intro

The number of reporters covering state politics and state legislatures has declined dramatically.  How might we turn that around?  This document approaches that question in the form of what you might call an "organizational job description" for a newly formed statehouse news service.  What should be covered?  How should it be staffed?  What's the focus?  Is it an organization with their own website that tries to attract their own audience?  Is it a wire service whose content appears in other publications?  Either way, where does the money come from?

## Can I add to this?  

Yes, absolutely.  Here are some instructions on how to add to this repository: [Here's a beginner's guide](http://nerds.inn.org/2015/03/17/contributing-to-the-inn-nerds-docs-repo-using-github-com/). Just substitute this repository for the one used as an example in the tutorial.  

If that feels like too much, you can just click [Issues](https://github.com/lisawilliams/community/issues/new) and let me know what's on your mind.  You'll need a (free) Github account to do so.

## A Job Description for Statehouse News in 2015

A statehouse news service in 2015 should cover important legislative and public policy issues, illuminate the state's use of taxpayer dollars, track and show the impact of lobbying dollars on the legislature, shine a spotlight on the personalities and debates of the state's capital, make use of public data to give citizens a clear and comprehensible view of complex issues, and above all, to hold the powerful, in and out of elective office, to account.

## A Reading List

Here are a collection of reports, articles and essays on the state of statehouse reporting today.  

*It’s time for a dramatic new approach grounded in community service. In a new report underwritten by the Ford Foundation that will be released tomorrow at Montclair State’s Engage Local conference, I attempt to draw lessons from a world not usually thought relevant to journalism: the three-decades-old movement of national and community service programs such as AmeriCorps, City Year, and Teach for America. A new national service program focused on local reporting would more efficiently deploy philanthropic resources to the media enterprises that need it most, while instilling a new sense of idealism into community-based coverage. It is time to Report for America.*

*Within America’s 50 state capitol buildings, 1,592 journalists inform the public about the actions and issues of state government, according to new data from the Pew Research Center. Of those statehouse reporters, nearly half (741) are assigned there full time. While that averages out to 15 full-time reporters per state, the actual number varies widely—from a high of 53 in Texas to just two in South Dakota. The remaining 851 statehouse reporters cover the beat less than full time.*

*As newspapers have withdrawn reporters from statehouses, others have attempted to fill the gap. For-profit and nonprofit digital news organizations, ideological outlets and high-priced publications aimed at insiders have popped up all over the country, often staffed by veteran reporters with experience covering state government. These nontraditional outlets employ 126 full-time statehouse reporters (17% of all full-time reporters). But that does not make up for the 164 newspaper statehouse jobs lost since 2003.*

*At the summit, two concepts stuck out. One involves a surge of resources, including more reporters, in the statehouses themselves; the other is an open-state database of legislative activity across all states.*

[Nontraditional Reporting Fills Gaps in Statehouse Coverage](http://journo.biz/2015/02/17/how-nontraditional-journalism-is-filling-the-gaps-in-declining-statehouse-reporting/), Luis Gomez, INN, 2015.


*I recently attended a conference in Chicago on how to improve statehouse reporting—looking not just at the reporters physically in our nation’s 50 state capitols, but also those covering the effects of Statehouse policies on agencies, departments, and the executive branch. Why is this important? (At least) two reasons: First, fully half of the state legislatures that met in 2012 passed more bills in one year than congress passed in two years. That’s a lot of bills. Second, just as with the broader field of journalism, statehouse reporting has experienced dramatic reductions in coverage in recent years.*

*I see nine themes for the digital emphasis of a statehouse reporter:*

*1. Live reporting of events.*
*2. Community engagement around the issues and events of the Capitol.*
*3. Reporting breaking news and enterprised scoops as the stories unfold.*
*4. Curation of content from other sources.*
*5. Enterprise and daily reporting based on analysis of data compiled by state agencies.*
*6. Video reporting of interviews and news events.*
*7. Mapping.*
*8. Digitally focused enterprise reporting.*
*9. Beatblogging.*

*Center for Public Integrity [is also] taking to the task of keeping statehouse reporting alive. CPI announced in September an initiative to hire 50 freelancers nationwide to cover corruption in state government. And in late January, the CPI produced a major report on state­level elections and money in politics.*

*[Anne] Galloway [of VTDigger] believes putting more reporters on the statehouse beat is the solution, and she expressed skepticism on whether there are any real solutions came out of the October meeting. Galloway wants to see whether the AP or the CPI will fulfill their goals of hiring more reporters. “If no hiring is done, let’s reconvene and see what’s happening,” she said. “We need to hire reporters.” There are mixed views on
whether there is even philanthropic interest to fund such projects. Galloway, for example, said “it was totally discouraging.” She said she left the October meeting with a sense that there is zero philanthropic funding for statehouse reporting. But she put the onus on practitioners and those who attended the meeting. “I think they want us to tell them what we want and come up with a plan, and they didn’t get that.*

*The sheer scale of what the Tribune has achieved in Texas may not be replicable to other settings.*

## Statehouse Reporting: a 50 State Inventory

**Note** *While local and regional newspapers and broadcast news operations do statehouse reporting, the following list doesn't focus on them (though we may add them, and if you would like to add an organization please do so).  Right now we are trying to surface networks/wire services, new state politics sites, etc.  We are also focusing on sites that have general coverage of state house and state level politics, so for now we are not adding sites that focus on policy for only one topic, such as education or health, on a statewide basis.*
